This results in a constrained camera, pose and lighting setup that makes the images look extremely static. My tool allows the artist to have more creative freedom by performing the mix operation in the 3D environment itself. The images shown here have been generated by this tool. | \-     |

I made a naive implementation by extracting features from images and sorted them by sharpness (FFT high frequency). If a feature had a sharpness above a certain threshold it would display as a point.
