The use of messages makes logging a breeze and helps prevent common threading pitfalls due to their atomic nature.                                                                                                                                                                      | \-     |

This results in a constrained camera, pose and lighting setup that makes the images look extremely static. My tool allows the artist to have more creative freedom by performing the mix operation in the 3D environment itself. The images shown here have been generated by this tool. | \-     |
| ![Code_PointCloud.gif](/img/user/Images/Code_PointCloud.gif)     | Cell visualizer                         | Generate and visualize pointcloud from cell images                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | I was curious to find out if I could create a 3d point cloud from cell images take at different focus depths. I made a naive implementation by extracting features from images and sorted them by sharpness (FFT high frequency). If a feature had a sharpness above a certain threshold it would display as a point. Color denotes the depth. Written in python. Uses Opencv, Numpy and Open3d.                       | \-     |

For a strong visual contrast I chose to use the primary colors and I really like how it looks.Written in python. Uses pygame.                                                                    | \-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | \-     |
| ![Code_Metaballs_Gif.gif](/img/user/Images/Code_Metaballs_Gif.gif)  | Bouncing metaballs                      | Metaballs display a fluid like attraction to one another when they get close enough. I found it so appealing that I tried several approaches before settling on this one. I like to optimize my algorithms before throwing more processing speed at them and I found a particular clever trick to get this to render real-time. Written in python.

| ![Code_Ledstrip.gif](/img/user/Images/Code_Ledstrip.gif)       | LEDstrip animation library and emulator | One of the members of ACKspace (xopr) created a 200 pixel LED strip whose LEDs were addressable by sending UDP packets. Enthusiastic about the project, I made an emulator and a library that allowed the easy creation and debugging of animations based on mathematical principles.                                                                           | \-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | \-     |

By pressing buttons it allows the user to change the rules of generation. One of the shapes that appears is the classic Sierpinski triangle. Written in python.

I implemented walking around, collisions, a mini-map and walls having different colors and was happy with the result.                                                                                  | \-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | \-     |

As an adult I like reading up on how the engine worked astonishingly well for its time. Depicted is the map of the first level of Doom 2. I wrote a python program that parsed the WAD file and drew the location of the walls and items as an exercise.                                                            | \-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | \-     |
